3	Maybe Amy Hood, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, should stay in power a little longer – or not.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) posted great results for the just ended quarter, sending the stock up as much as 4% Friday.

Revenue jumped 14% to a record $24.5 billion and earnings per share of 78 cents beat Wall Street estimates by 10 cents. Microsoft shares settled down after the initial surge and were up 2% at midday amid a falling overall market that hammered most other tech stocks.\n	6	2	0	3	0.0400000000000000008	0	2014-01-25 00:16:49.041966	f
5	A closer look\n\nLooking closely, too much of the surprise came from one-time boosts, cost cutting and gains in weaker product lines that won’t help much in the future.\n\nStarting with Microsoft’s most profitable niche, sales of Windows and Office software were higher than expected. Overall PC shipments dipped about 6% in the quarter, according to market research firm NPD, but Microsoft’s Windows revenue dropped just 3%.\n	6	2	0	3	0.0500000000000000028	0	2014-01-25 00:16:49.041966	f
6	Unfortunately, the surprise was all on the corporate side, where Microsoft’s decision to end support for Windows XP last year has given sales a short-term bump. Windows 8 remains a controversial product and some analysts say many companies have been asking to install Windows 7 when they upgrade. The shift also helped Office sales, as companies shifted to newer versions as they upgraded operating systems.\n	6	2	0	3	0.0500000000000000028	0	2014-01-25 00:16:49.041966	f

24	As a result, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett, among investors, “emerging markets are about as popular as Dennis Rodman at a UN Security Council meeting.”\n\nSizing up specific country markets against individual mega-cap U.S. stocks, Hartnett notes the relative enthusiasm for each market segment is stark: Google Inc. (GOOG) alone has a higher market value than the entire MSCI Brazil index, Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) is now “bigger” than India and Starbucks Corp.

28	The quarter may well be the last full one for Ballmer, and it at least showed some positive momentum for the Surface tablet, Microsoft's long-delayed attempt to knock Apple's iPad off its perch.\n \n"It's a good print to ride off into the sunset with, for the current CEO," said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. "There's still the over-arching question for this company: who's going to be the new CEO, and what direction they take."\n 	25	1	5	3	0.0500000000000000028	0	2014-01-25 00:16:49.041966	f

8	Another supposed bright spot was sales of the Surface tablet, which doubled from the prior quarter to $893 million. It’s good that Surface tablets are selling better but Hood admitted the effort is still losing money. And the numbers are still so miniscule as to be almost irrelevant in the overall tablet market. In the third quarter – before the holiday shopping period – Apple sold 14.1 million iPads worth $6.2 billion. It’s expected to report selling 23 million to 25 million worth well over $10 billion for the holiday period. And Apple may not even be the leader in tablets anymore, with Android-based devices selling at an even higher rate.\n	6	1	0	3	0.0700000000000000067	0	2014-01-25 00:16:49.041966	f
9	For Microsoft, going from complete tablet irrelevance to only mostly irrelevant isn’t going to make up for years of further declining PC sales.\n\nAnd Microsoft’s other hardware play, Nokia’s handset division, reported earlier it barely sold more smartphones in the fourth quarter, 8.8 million, than in the prior quarter when it sold 8.2 million.\n	6	2	0	3	0.0400000000000000008	0	2014-01-25 00:16:49.041966	f

13	After a year of triple-digit gains for the likes of Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA), Best Buy (BBY), and Facebook (FB), investors are busy trying to find the next big winner. According to Joe Fahmy, managing director at Zor Capital, these so-called “momentum plays” typically have two common traits.“On the fundamental side, their earnings and sales are accelerating,” Fahmy says in the attached video. “And on the technical side, they’re usually breaking out of some sort of technical pattern and moving to the upside.”With that in mind, Fahmy brought a list of ideas to Breakout that he thinks could fit the bill and deliver the kind of upside investor dream of.Fahmy’s first pick is hardly a new theme but it is clearly showing renewed signs of momentum. While the Biotech sector (IBB)  has been rising and setting record highs for six years, its recent surge looks to be accelerating. Specifically, the sector gained 65% last year and 32% the year before, but a two-month sprint of close to 20%, (representing 4x outperformance versus the S&P 500) is a sign that better days are ahead.“I still think it’s in a great uptrend,” says Fahmy in the attached video.  “A lot of the companies (in it) still have powerful earnings growth, huge pipelines of (new) drugs and will continue to grow through acquisition. I think some of the bigger names (CELG, GILD, AMGN, BIIB) will be bigger than Merck or Pfizer 3 to 5 years from now.”Fahmy also see lots of blossoming growth within tech right now, particularly amongst companies that manage and manipulate so called “big data.” One such momentum play that he likes is a company called Splunk (SPLK). Since its debut in April 2012, this San Francisco based provider of operational intelligence has risen more than 140% “Every deal that’s going on in big data, meaning the indexing of all this data, Splunk is involved,” Fahmy says. “They’re the leader and the main company in this space.” For the record, Splunk is forecast to deliver 66% EPS growth this quarter and 40% sales growth.The final so-called ‘mo-mo’ pick from Fahmy is a play on the boom in data and internet security. Again, he has chosen to play it via a new but rapidly growing company called FireEye (FEYE).  “It’s made a big run recently,“ he says of the stock which came public at $20 four months ago and closed yesterday at $70. “Longer term I think this is one of the biggest players, and you’re (still) getting this early.”He’s the first to admit that these types of stocks often ‘’get ahead of themselves” and that would-be buyers need to be on the look out for dips and consolidations. In fact, just this week, JPMorgan downgraded FireEye to neutral from overweight in the wake of its huge short-term move. “Fundamentally, these companies are the new growth names,” he says, noting that most investors still aren’t familiar with them. “As you research them and get to know their stories, you’ll find that these are big winners potentially in the long term.”\n	9	3	0	3	0.309999999999999998	0	2014-01-25 00:16:49.041966	f

36	By Edwin Chan\n \nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn picked up another $500 million of Apple Inc shares on Thursday to take his investment in the iPhone maker to $3.6 billion, while ratcheting up his months-long campaign to pry open the company's cash hoard.\n 	28	1	10	3	0.0299999999999999989	0	2014-01-25 00:16:49.041966	f
37	Icahn, who repeatedly has called Apple a "no brainer" even as he wages a campaign to get it to return more cash to shareholders, tweeted his latest move just a day after revealing a position of over $3 billion in the company.\n \nIn a lengthy letter to shareholders filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, Icahn urged shareholders to vote "yea" to his proposal for a new $50 billion buyback, and laid out familiar arguments as to why Apple should share more of its $146 billion cash hoard.\n 	28	1	10	3	0.0599999999999999978	0	2014-01-25 00:16:49.041966	f
38	Apple's strong market position in smartphones and tablets does not justify the company's official stance that it needed to maintain reserves to compete in a fast-evolving consumer electronics industry, Icahn said.\n \nHe said the stock's price-to-earnings multiple stood 71 percent below the S&P 500's and that the shares could be worth $840 if that gap was closed. An expansion of its capital return program could help bridge that difference, while allowing the company to express confidence in its own stock.\n 	28	1	10	3	0.0599999999999999978	0	2014-01-25 00:16:49.041966	f
39	"Even if the story ended with Apple's existing product and software lines, we would still choose to make Apple our largest investment," Icahn said in the letter.\n \n"But there is more to the story!

42	On Thursday, he set his sights again on Apple, accusing its board of lacking investment management experience.\n \nIt was unclear when or how much stock the activist investor, who in August began trying to get Cook to agree to a $150 billion buyback, now holds. In a letter to Cook made public on October 24, Icahn said he had increased his stake to 4.7 million shares.\n 	28	1	10	3	0.0400000000000000008	0	2014-01-25 00:16:49.041966	f

It said it had already returned $43 billion in dividends and repurchases.\n \nBut more could be done, Icahn argued.\n \n"Given this massive net cash position and robust earnings generation, Apple is perhaps the most overcapitalized company in corporate history," Icahn said in his letter.\n 	28	1	10	3	0.0500000000000000028	0	2014-01-25 00:16:49.041966	f

113	Icahn, who repeatedly has called Apple a "no brainer" even as he wages a campaign to get it to return more cash to shareholders, tweeted his latest move just a day after revealing a position of over $3 billion in the company.\n \nIn a lengthy letter to shareholders filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, Icahn urged shareholders to vote "yea" to his proposal for a new $50 billion buyback, and laid out familiar arguments as to why Apple should share more of its $146 billion cash hoard.\n 	70	1	5	3	0.0599999999999999978	0	2014-01-25 11:41:05.389943	f

84	Unfortunately, the surprise was all on the corporate side, where Microsoft’s decision to end support for Windows XP last year has given sales a short-term bump.

90	After a year of triple-digit gains for the likes of Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA), Best Buy (BBY), and Facebook (FB), investors are busy trying to find the next big winner. According to Joe Fahmy, managing director at Zor Capital, these so-called “momentum plays” typically have two common traits.“On the fundamental side, their earnings and sales are accelerating,” Fahmy says in the attached video. “And on the technical side, they’re usually breaking out of some sort of technical pattern and moving to the upside.”With that in mind, Fahmy brought a list of ideas to Breakout that he thinks could fit the bill and deliver the kind of upside investor dream of.Fahmy’s first pick is hardly a new theme but it is clearly showing renewed signs of momentum. While the Biotech sector (IBB)  has been rising and setting record highs for six years, its recent surge looks to be accelerating. Specifically, the sector gained 65% last year and 32% the year before, but a two-month sprint of close to 20%, (representing 4x outperformance versus the S&P 500) is a sign that better days are ahead.“I still think it’s in a great uptrend,” says Fahmy in the attached video.  “A lot of the companies (in it) still have powerful earnings growth, huge pipelines of (new) drugs and will continue to grow through acquisition. I think some of the bigger names (CELG, GILD, AMGN, BIIB) will be bigger than Merck or Pfizer 3 to 5 years from now.”Fahmy also see lots of blossoming growth within tech right now, particularly amongst companies that manage and manipulate so called “big data.” One such momentum play that he likes is a company called Splunk (SPLK). Since its debut in April 2012, this San Francisco based provider of operational intelligence has risen more than 140% “Every deal that’s going on in big data, meaning the indexing of all this data, Splunk is involved,” Fahmy says. “They’re the leader and the main company in this space.” For the record, Splunk is forecast to deliver 66% EPS growth this quarter and 40% sales growth.The final so-called ‘mo-mo’ pick from Fahmy is a play on the boom in data and internet security. Again, he has chosen to play it via a new but rapidly growing company called FireEye (FEYE).  “It’s made a big run recently,“ he says of the stock which came public at $20 four months ago and closed yesterday at $70. “Longer term I think this is one of the biggest players, and you’re (still) getting this early.”He’s the first to admit that these types of stocks often ‘’get ahead of themselves” and that would-be buyers need to be on the look out for dips and consolidations. In fact, just this week, JPMorgan downgraded FireEye to neutral from overweight in the wake of its huge short-term move. “Fundamentally, these companies are the new growth names,” he says, noting that most investors still aren’t familiar with them. “As you research them and get to know their stories, you’ll find that these are big winners potentially in the long term.”\n	54	3	0	3	0.309999999999999998	0	2014-01-25 11:41:05.389943	f

112	By Edwin Chan\n \nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn picked up another $500 million of Apple Inc shares on Thursday to take his investment in the iPhone maker to $3.6 billion, while ratcheting up his months-long campaign to pry open the company's cash hoard.\n 	70	1	5	3	0.0299999999999999989	0	2014-01-25 11:41:05.389943	f

123	Of all the sexy growth stories vying for attention in the tech sector, none is as boldly opportunistic as Microsoft’s (MSFT) new effort to tap into growing global outrage over spying by the National Security Agency.In an unprecedented move, Microsoft is now offering its customers abroad to choose where they would like to have their data stored, and comes as the backlash over U.S. surveillance operations intensifies.“People should have the ability to make an informed choice of where their data resides," said Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith yesterday.As my co-host Jeff Macke and I discuss in the attached video, the action by the software giant may be the first of its kind, but is surely won’t be the last. In fact, by getting a jump on its industry rivals, Microsoft is making a shrewd business decision that could pay off in spades.In addition, Microsoft’s pushback comes on the very same day that the government’s new privacy watchdog is set to release a report that calls the NSA’s indiscriminate data gathering illegal, scarcely effective and calls for it to be closed down. So far, President Obama and anti-terrorism operatives have given almost no ground in the face of public protestations over the program. As recently as last week, the President sought to soothe concerns in an address to the nation on the issue, but polls show what little he offered in the form of concessions or curtailment did nothing to sway opinion.\n	73	2	\N	3	0.149999999999999994	0	2014-01-25 11:41:05.389943	f
124	In fact, a new poll from USA Today shows a majority of Americans are against the President on the surveillance program and have little confidence that policies will be changed. One can only presume that an equally large number of non-Americans are opposed to it as well, which is why Microsoft is stepping up to meet demand.To be fair, even if Microsoft - or other companies - start to house more data offshore, it would seem at best to be ineffective given the NSA’s widely reported foreign data collection operations in places like Brazil and Europe. There’s also the unsettling reality that the government can always demand access to the data if and when it feels the need.“What the government has done is to create a market opportunity for companies to go offshore with this data,” Macke declares. “It’s a curious turn of events.”\n	73	2	\N	3	0.0899999999999999967	0	2014-01-25 11:41:05.389943	f

131	One day after he used Twitter to announce the purchase of another $500 million worth of Apple (AAPL) stock, Carl Icahn attacked the company in a lengthy open letter to his "fellow Apple shareholders" on Thursday afternoon.\n\n"Given the degree to which Apple appears undervalued to us, we feel it's almost a waste of time to debate the point," wrote Icahn in his nearly 3,000 word note. The extreme activist proceeded to argue that Apple should capitalize on "advancements in miniaturization and continued improvements in Siri" to produce an extended list of products from wearable gadgets to televisions.\n	77	1	\N	3	0.0700000000000000067	0	2014-01-25 11:41:05.389943	f

134	 After the bell, Microsoft Corp said fiscal second-quarter profit rose 3 percent, as strong sales of its Office software to businesses offset another weak quarter for its flagship Windows system, and as consumers increasingly favor tablets over personal computers.

133	The Icahn-effect is punditry taken to the extreme. There’s nothing immoral or illegal about arguing a stock you hold is undervalued. Icahn saying Apple shares are a good buy is an opinion, not a command. Icahn is telling people what he really believes. He’d argue what he’s doing isn’t exploitation but giving tremendously valuable financial advice for free and having a blast doing it. Given that type of influence and platform McCullough or I would do more or less the same thing.\n	77	1	\N	3	0.0500000000000000028	0	2014-01-25 11:41:05.389943	f

It’s good that Surface tablets are selling better but Hood admitted the effort is still losing money. And the numbers are still so miniscule as to be almost irrelevant in the overall tablet market. In the third quarter – before the holiday shopping period – Apple sold 14.1 million iPads worth $6.2 billion. It’s expected to report selling 23 million to 25 million worth well over $10 billion for the holiday period. And Apple may not even be the leader in tablets anymore, with Android-based devices selling at an even higher rate.\n	52	1	0	3	0.0700000000000000067	0	2014-01-25 11:41:05.389943	f
